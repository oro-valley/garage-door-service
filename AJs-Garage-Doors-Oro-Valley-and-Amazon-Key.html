In a recent article, Amazon announced, &quot;Amazon has partnered with the company Chamberlain to work with their WiFi enabled MyQ garage door openers and accessories, for the purpose of adding the ability to deliver Amazon packages directly into your garage while you're not home.&quot;</p><div style="float:right; padding:8px;"><img alt="AJ's has Amazon Key for Garage compatible garage door openers by LiftMaster" src="https://storage.pressadvantage.com/uploads/image/6668/AJ_s_Garage_Doors_Oro_Valley_and_Amazon_Key.jpg"></div><p>Amazon continued, &quot;The new service is free and part of Amazon's Key service, which previously gave you the option of allowing Amazon delivery personnel access to your front door for the same purpose. This extends that option to the garage as well, or as an alternative.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We take pride in ensuring that all our customers get the right choice of garage door opener for their needs,&quot; said Jennifer Banks, a spokesperson for AJ's Garage Door Service of Oro Valley. &quot;We know many feel more comfortable giving access to their garage rather then to their front door. This is great news for all our customers who have already installed LiftMaster/Chamberlain openers. For those needing or considering a new garage door opener, who desire Amazon delivery access once it rolls out to Tucson and Oro Valley, we can install a new LiftMaster opener in your garage.&quot;</p><p>AJ's Garage Door Service is a small local Tucson business founded on hard work, honesty, and integrity.

Such customers are often confounded by the costs involved, so repairs are often delayed or put off entirely. However, AJ's can take care of any issue, from broken springs, misaligned or bent tracks or damaged rollers, broken garage door cables, weather stripping, damaged door panels, faulty openers and so on. They can also install garage door openers and undertake a complete door rebuild if required.</p><p>The company was recently featured on Press Advantage for an <a href="https://www.pressadvantage.com/organization/aj-s-garage-door-service-of-oro-valley">excellent review from a customer</a> who was impressed with their quick response time and pricing, which was far lower than her neighbor told her to expect to pay.

During site inspections, we thoroughly assess all of the mechanical parts and salvage the ones that can still be used, so that homeowners will not be forced to buy anything that they don't really need.&quot;</p><p>Those who have issues with a garage door which does not close all the way or has an annoying, grinding noise is encouraged to give the company a call straight away. This can help ensure that a small maintenance and repair job does not become a more serious issue which would require a full replacement.</p><p>&quot;Anyone looking to use <a href="https://www.ajsgaragedoorservice.com/amazons-garage-delivery-oro-valley-ajs-garage-doors">Amazon's Key for Garage delivery service in Oro Valley or Tucson</a> may wish to make sure their garage door is in perfect working order before signing up for Amazon to leave packages directly in their garage while they are not home.
