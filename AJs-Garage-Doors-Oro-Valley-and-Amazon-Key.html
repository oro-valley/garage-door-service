In a recent article, Amazon announced, &quot;Amazon has partnered with the company Chamberlain to work with their WiFi enabled MyQ garage door openers and accessories, for the purpose of adding the ability to deliver Amazon packages directly into your garage while you're not home.&quot;</p><div style="float:right; padding:8px;"><img alt="AJ's has Amazon Key for Garage compatible garage door openers by LiftMaster" src="https://storage.pressadvantage.com/uploads/image/6668/AJ_s_Garage_Doors_Oro_Valley_and_Amazon_Key.jpg"></div><p>Amazon continued, &quot;The new service is free and part of Amazon's Key service, which previously gave you the option of allowing Amazon delivery personnel access to your front door for the same purpose. This extends that option to the garage as well, or as an alternative.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We take pride in ensuring that all our customers get the right choice of garage door opener for their needs,&quot; said Jennifer Banks, a spokesperson for AJ's Garage Door Service of Oro Valley. &quot;We know many feel more comfortable giving access to their garage rather then to their front door.

They can also install garage door openers and undertake a complete door rebuild if required.</p><p>The company was recently featured on Press Advantage for an <a href="https://www.pressadvantage.com/organization/aj-s-garage-door-service-of-oro-valley">excellent review from a customer</a> who was impressed with their quick response time and pricing, which was far lower than her neighbor told her to expect to pay.
